### The purpose of this project was to practice HTML, CSS and JS

I followed this course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjOeA5heVpg&list=PL-UTrxF0y8kKGrBg1OaBhoP8PWdJqR5Qg

and this project was the playground to try and learn new ideas.

Main entry to the website is `kurs.html`. Also, I was practicing adding forms to the website. To see that, you can open `formulari.html`.
